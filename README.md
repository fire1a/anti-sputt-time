# anti-sputt-time
remember kids, stay in school, and don't do sputt time
i think this mod is very neccesary for a healthy and balanced playtime on the DiamondFire server

What the mod actually does:
 - Prevents the joining of sputt time in anyway, shape or form.
 - Stops you from joining via the game menu or via commands.
