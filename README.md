# anti-sputt-time
remember kids, stay in school, and don't play sputt time

i think this mod is very neccesary for a healthy and balanced playtime on the DiamondFire server

What the mod actually does:
 - Stops you from joining via the game menu or via commands.
 
Furture features? 
 - blocks chat messages coming from sputt time on node 2
